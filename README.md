### Abstract

Learning informative, generalisable, and transferrable representations of graph-structured data
using self-supervised learning is a fundamental problem in many real-world tasks, when labelled
data are expensive and limited. Most of the existing works incorporate manual augmentations to
the graphs, as inspired by self-supervised learning methods for image data. We propose a novel
approach for self-supervised pre-training of graph neural networks based on reinforcement learning.
We plan to design appropriate games and rewards for graph neural networks with different
levels of expressiveness, and aim to build a framework that can do principled self-supervised
learning without the need of handcrafted augmentations.
